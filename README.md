# SpotipyDisplay
In order to expand my CS knowledge, I developed a display that will display a user's currently playing song and artist. This project is relatively simple, but was mainly a learning experience, as this was my first time utilizing APIs and the Tkinter graphics library in Python. 

The learning process of this project was fairly simple; however, actually developing this program was extremely challenging. Spotify's API is designed for web development. There is a Python library known as Spotipy that allows Python developers to utilize the API; however due to the project being small and independant, the documentation for it is very limiting and I had to reverse engineer the majority of my utilization of the API. However, the library provided me with all the tools necessary and made the process extremely streamlined.
